# Programming Languages
This repository contains all my languages I developed in High school.
License is GPLv3.

All of these programming languages reached a state of turing completenes
and were able to be executed on their respective platform.

Awesome: 2014
My personal programming language, has its own repostory

CrossPlatformBasic: 2013
Idea was to write BASIC on one platform and run it on many other platforms,
by transpilation to C.

GLBScript: 2012
Idea of GLScriptBasic, but transpilation to JavaScript. Idea later 
transformed into 123basic (which has its own repository)

GLScriptBasic: 2012
Script engine for GLBasic running in GLBasic.

Lumpy: 2011
Simple programming language. Transpilation to C.

TEN: 2011
Programming language which was intended to have only 10 keywords.

ConsoleBASIC: 2010
Same idea as CrossPlatformBasic, but the compiler was not as sophisticated
as CrossPlatformBasic

ROBERT: 2010
Script Engine for Java. Written in first class of high school as a project.

Simple Script 3/Thunder Script: 2009
